There's life living inside every electronic device. 

uSect gives you the ability of seeing the unseen. An ecosystem of "bugs" that eating lost bytes of your memory and each other. While also evolving and procreating.


Structure
=============

uSect is developed using the [uOS middleware](https://github.com/UnBiquitous/uos_core/) and [uImpala Game Engine](https://github.com/matheuscscp/uImpala/)

The whole game is available in the `src` folder. The packaging for running it on PCs and Android devices are available at `launchers`.

=============

For building this project you'll need to use [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/).

Since uSect is still in development we rely on current unstable versions of the following libraries:

- [uOS-Core 3.2.0](https://github.com/UnBiquitous/uos_core/)
- [uOS-Socket-Plugin 3.2.0](https://github.com/UnBiquitous/uos_socket_plugin)
