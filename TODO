NEEDED:
	- Move players based on a directional controller
	- Connect environments

IDEAS :
	- Players must be able to interact (interact, steal objects, deliver objects)
	- Different environments must interact among them
	- Environment affects Sect speed
	- Sects should have more characteristics
	- Sects have parts
	- Reproduction must mix characteristics (with mutation)
	- Better handle configuration of java.library.path for lwjgl and sigar
		Ex: java -Djava.library.path=target/natives/:include/:lib/ -jar target/uSect-1.0-DEV-jar-with-dependencies.jar s
	- Better handle disconnections:
		- uos-core : remove caches when a device is no longer at sight.
		- uos-socket : should not break when socket times out or wifi disconnects
			- For disconnection, maybe we need to change our strategy fo,r network managers.
